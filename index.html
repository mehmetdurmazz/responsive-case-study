      <h1>Media Query</h1>
      <p>Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's general type (such as
        print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport
        width).</p>
      <p>A media query is composed of an optional media type and any number of media feature expressions. Multiple
        queries can be combined in various ways by using logical operators. Media queries are case-insensitive.</p>

      <p>A media query computes to true when the media type (if specified) matches the device on which a document is
        being displayed and all media feature expressions compute as true. Queries involving unknown media types are
        always false.</p>
